Here you can "roll the dice" for ideas on what your next meal should include. Currently, there are preprogrammed dice you can choose from: Sober, Drunk, Munchies, Sweet, Custom or take on a Mystery Box Challege.

Once the category is selected, the computer "rolls the dice".

Run the program.

A menu will appear with the following options:
	
	Choose how sober you are:
		- Straight Edge
		- Druuuunk
		- MUNCHIES!!!!
		- Sweet
		- Mystery Box Cooking Challenge

Once the dice has been chosen:
	
	You selected (name of dice), are you ready to roll? 'Yes' or 'No'

	If 'Yes':
		print "Alright! Here goes! You should (cook/eat(depending on dice selection))..."

	elif 'No':
		print "Really? You're that indecisive? Fine!"

If the Mystery Box Cooking Challenge is selected, the user will be offered 5 outcomes: meat, veggie, starch, fruit and spice. These outcomes will result in a "shopping list" and the challenge is to make a meal with these items as a base.

First a message will print:
	"So, you don't know what to eat? I have some ideas, but first, I need you to answer some quesitons. All questions will ask you for a number on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being the least favorable and 10 being the most favorable. Are you ready? Yes or no?"

Then, the user will be asked a series of questions:

	- How sober are you on a scale of 1 to 10?

	- Do you want to eat in or do you have nothing in the house?

	- Do you want something meaty or are you a veg head?

	- Are you in the mood for something sweet of savory?
